## tl;dr
With this second post in our trading journey with cryptocurrencies, I will cover:

* why I chose Binance
* sign up into binance
* brief tour of the Binane web interface
* get some bitcoins on your account

## Why Binance?

1. Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. They offer in excess of 380 tradable assets
2. They have a low transaction fee 0.1% trading fee, even lower if you use the BNB currency as a transaction fee
3. Good programming API interface
4. Sometimes they have a trading lottery contest or coin drops, I have been fortunate enough to get some coins on both occasions

## Signing up

<img class="img-left" style="background-color:white;padding:2px;width:114px;float:right" titel="binance signup referral" alt="binance signup referral" src="/assets/images/qr.jpg"/>

You can join me for the series using [Binance Exchange](https://www.binance.com/?ref=35360148), 
this is a referrer link so when you sign up not all the trading transaction fees are going to Binance :-)

![Binance Trading Page]({{ "/assets/images/binance.png" | relative_url }})

Sign up with a durable email address where you are in charge of the email spam settings. I had some issues with a domain registrar who is marking the binance emails as spam and could do nothing about it :-(

After the confirmation email, you can start trading after your deposit. 
You have a withdraw limit of 2 BTC per 24H, that will suffice for these series.
For larger amounts, you have to present legal ID's, I tried but got stuck in the process.

I will strongly recommend that 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) is enabled, get [Google Authenticator](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000433432-Google-Guide-2FA) on your phone!

## Tour of Binance web interface

Before we are adding some BTC to our accounts, we will do a brief summary of the web interface, this will prevent accidental buy/sell actions on your part.

### landing page menu

![Binance Balances]({{ "/assets/images/balances-menu.png" | relative_url }})

As far as trading is concerned the following menu items are relevant:

### Exchange
This is the heart of the trading system and is the central interface where trading orders are placed, it comes with a basic and advanced view

![Exchange basic]({{ "/assets/images/basic-exchange.png" | relative_url }})

We will delve into this view in a later post.

### funds
Here you have an overview of the deposits/withdrawals/transaction history and current assets overview (redacted), see image below

![Funds]({{ "/assets/images/balances.png" | relative_url }})

with deposits/withdrawals we can move funds in and out of Binance, we will cover the deposits later in this blog post.

### orders
Here is an overview of the current open orders of selling and buying assets parts of these views are exposed in the exchange view.

### academy
This menu item is recently added, here you can increase your cryptocurrency related knowledge!

![Academy]({{ "/assets/images/binance-academy.png" | relative_url }})

### account
Here you can change your setting, you can see that I am a level 1 verified, have 2FA enabled and have an anti-phishing code for email communication. 
This will identify unsolicited email from rogue individuals. The API key is to enable programs to interact with the binance exchange, this will be a topic for later posts.

## How to make your first deposit on Binance

To identify your wallet address, go to the deposits menu item after you logged on.

Here you should pay attention to choose the correct asset BTC.

Don't copy my address they serve as an example unless you want to make a donation to support these series ;-)

![Balances]({{ "/assets/images/funds-deposit.png" | relative_url }})

For extra measure do a ctr-f (Windows) cmd+f (Osx) paste the address in the search box on the screen and make sure that the entirety of the address is selected when found.

If you can use the QR code on your phone use that as your wallet address selector.

In case of an existing wallet with an adequate amount of BTC, you can transfer directly to the Binance wallet address using the QR address code or the copied address from the website.

### Buying bitcoins

* Buying bitcoins requires proper legal identification.

I used [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) to buy bitcoins with my credit card. The buying fees are quite high.

Transfer the coins to the correct Binance address, this may take a while (15+ minutes) for the transaction to complete, the fees are substantially lower and depending on the BTC amount.

Note there are many other trusted places where you can buy bitcoins, for example [cubits](https://cubits.com/)

They use an external kick-ass Identification process called 'ID now' where you get to meet a real MIB, below you see the cost breakdown of buying â‚¬500 worth of bitcoins.

Now you are ready to trade!

Next posts will be more focused on the exchange trading view, the various orders you can make. 

What my ideas are when to buy or sell, which assets to choose from. Do some experimenting and have some trading fun for profit.
