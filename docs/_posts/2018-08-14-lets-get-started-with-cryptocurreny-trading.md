excerpt: cryptocurrency trading journey noob blog series
---

## Introduction
These upcoming weekly blog series is a journey into cryptocurrency trading. 
I am trying to make a profit using a different kind of tools strategies and techniques. As a trading noob maybe we can help each other, pointing out my mistakes and take this journey together, gaining trading knowledge and perhaps a slight profit! 

## Let me introduce myself
As a polyglot programmer fluently in Java, Golang and not so fluent in [Julialang](https://julialang.org/). I will occasionally resort to the julia scripting language, trying to gain some insights into the cryptocurrency trends. 

**Don't be alarmed these series will be easy to digest.**

## Rules
Some rules into crypto trading are applicable I will state them here:

1.  **Don't use any money you can't afford to lose!**<br/>
*the cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, sometimes 38% gain/loss is achievable in 24 hours.*
1. Don't quit your day job, these series are ***not*** going to make you a Trading Tsar :-)
2. Don't be greedy!<br/>*a profit of 1% is still a profit.*
1. Don't blame me if there's is a loss in your account balances, these series are just experiments with perhaps an accidental profit :-)

## Binance
You can join me for the series using [Binance Exchange](https://www.binance.com/?ref=35360148), this is a referrer link so when you sign up not all the trading transaction fees are going to Binance :-)

![Binance Trading Page]({{ "/assets/images/binance.png" | absolute_url }})

I chose Binance (no affiliation) because :
* Its the largest exchange there is,
* has an excellent programming interface, 
* and has challenges for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).

# Goals
* get up and running with Binance,
* understand the Binance interface and trading algorithms,
* apply different trading experiments,
* long-term goal, programmatically trade with Julialang.
* have some fun and excitement!

<br/>
With kind regards,
